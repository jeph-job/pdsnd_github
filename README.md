### Project Title
Bikeshare Analysis

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to **bike share systems** for three major cities in the United Statesâ€” _Chicago, New York City, and Washington_. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
